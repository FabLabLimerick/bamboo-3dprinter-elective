=========================

These are the results of the digital fabrication course carried out as part of the School of Architecture, University of Limerick Autumn 2013 Elective Programme. In two weeks a group of five students explored the design and fabrication of low-cost, resistant and made-to-size structures that could be embedded within the actual Georgian Limerick urban fabric to allow temporary uses and prevent further deterioration of abandoned buildings.

Our research efforts focused on unusual materials and technologies such as bamboo, cardboard tubes and 3d printing, since previous studies have shown enormous potential for erecting strong and cost effective structures. 

This research was done by the students Sandra Bischoff, Julien Chapel, Peter Dowling, Brian Hoey & Rubén Martínez Olivencia and coordinated by Michael McLaughling (teaching assistant) & Javier Burón (lecturer)
