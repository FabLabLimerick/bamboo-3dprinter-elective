=========================

This is the results of the digital fabrication course carried during the autumn semester 2013 as part of the School of Architecture, University of Limerick elective programme. In this two weeks we explored the design and fabrication of low-cost, resistant and made-to-size structures. The resulting structures are planned to be embedded within the actual Georgian Limerick urban fabric to allow temporary uses and prevent further deterioration of abandoned buildings. Our research efforts focused on unusual materials and technologies such as bamboo, cardboard tubes and 3d printing, since previous studies have shown enormous potential for erecting strong and cost effective structures.
